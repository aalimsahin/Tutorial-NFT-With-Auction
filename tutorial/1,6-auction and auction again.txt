We end our shortcomings by asking the owner of Nft if he wants an auction.
Let's start by editing our reach code.

$[tut5=>index.rsh-4,9]
Line 8 provides a method: isAuctionOn, which returns a boolean.

$[tut5=>index.rsh-34,51]
Line 34, we add a new variable.
With this variable, we will keep the information whether the auction is requested or not.

Lines 39 through 45 are checking the auction request.
The auctionOn variable is false at startup and after every owner change.
According to the response from the isAuctionOn function, the program terminates or continues.

We update lines 69, 74 and 84.

Let's also make the necessary arrangements to tie these changes to the Javascript frontend.

$[tut5=>index.mjs-33,56]
Line 34, we were ending the program with the if condition we placed inside the seeOutcome function.
Since it is no longer needed, we remove and update it.

Lines 47 through 56 define isAuctionOn function.

Lines 49 through 52, return false so that the program terminates after the second auction.

Let’s run the program and see what happens:

$ ./reach run

Until this step, we made a Javascript command-line interface for our Reach program.
In the next step, we’ll replace this with a Web interface for the same Reach program.
